language for <strong>creating <u>web</u> pages</strong> and web applications
 yperText Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications.
 This format description is for HTML 5,  standardized in two coordinated efforts.</p>
<img src="4.jpg" width="50%">
  <p style="margin-top:40px;">One is by the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG), which maintains
  a specification for HTML as a modularized "living standard" at https://html.spec.whatwg.org/.
  The second is at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). A series of snapshots of well-supported
  modules have been compiled and published as W3C Recommendations: 5.0 (2014); 5.1 (2016); 5.2 (2017),
   with future snapshots expected. The latest W3C Recommendation is at the URL https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/.
   See Notes below for more on the relationship between W3C and WHATWG.</P>
